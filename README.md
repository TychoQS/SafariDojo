# Safari Dojo

## Description
**Safari Dojo** is a web-based learning platform made up of interactive quizzes that aim to encourage students between the ages of 6 and 11 to learn. The main objective will be to associate the concept of gamification with the academic environment and,
in this way, to combat, with its own antithesis, products such as social networks that, far from providing value to the student, disturb their attention. The application will provide a series of ‘_Quizzes_’ as a learning tool. These 
so-called ‘_Quizzes_’ will consist of mini-games that implement didactic content as if it were a videogame.
